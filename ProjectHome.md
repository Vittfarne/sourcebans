SourceBans is a global administration and banning system for Source engine based servers. Admins can be set on individual servers, or if you want, you can create a group of servers. And when adding an admin, you will have the option to give that admin the privaleges on that group of servers. So adding admins is easy and fast....

With SourceBans, its as simple as sm\_ban in the server console, and that player will be instantly banned from all of your servers.

## Admin Management System ##
As-well as having a kick ass ban system for all of your servers, SourceBans allows you to manage all of your SourceMod admins though a simple and easy to understand web panel. For example, you can create a new admin group which will only be able to kick and ban. After this, you can add a new admin, type the required information and add that admin to that new group, and that admin will automatically inherit all of the privalages from that group. And starting next map, the admin will have the specified level of admin in the server, or group of servers that you have set.

Admins can be set on individual servers, or if you want, you can create a group of servers. And when adding an admin, you will have the option to give that admin the privaleges on that group of servers. So adding admins is easy and fast.
